All templates released at Clantemplates include blank banner images for you to add your own clans name to in order to
personalize the template. Such images are generally included in the images folder which was in the zip file you downloaded.
This may also include other blank images for various parts of a template depending on the template you've downloaded.
For this template, all the blank images is stored in the subfolder "blank images" in the "images" folder.

Also, there's font's included in this template to keep the "CLAN NAME", "slogan goes here" and menu in the same style as the default.
Those are in the subfolder "fonts" and is not nessesary to upload.


So...do you still have questions that the video tutorials just didn't cover? Well the best place to get the kind of answers you
need is to use that template you've downloaded is to submit your question for the Support Staff in the Clantemplates
